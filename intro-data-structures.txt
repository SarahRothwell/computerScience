Question 1
a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

let array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];


b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.

array.push("Mary");

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

var findJosh = array.indexOf("Josh")

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?

var findEmily = array.indexOf("Emily")

If the item is not in the array the return should be -1

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?


array.splice(1, 0, "Melissa")


f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

Option 1:

for (let i=0; i<array.length-1; i++){
  if(array[i] == "Patrick"){
    array.splice(i,1);
  }
}

Option 2:

array.splice(4, 1)


Q2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A. Create a shopping list using a stack.

Q3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A. push() to add an element to the top of an array or pop() to remove element from end of array.
