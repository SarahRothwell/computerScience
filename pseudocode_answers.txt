Short Answers

Q1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is an easy way to work through problems and communicate ideas with other people without the use of complex syntax of a programming language.

Programming Assignment

Q1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION greaterNumber (firstNumber, secondNumber)
	IF the firstNumber is greater than the secondNumber THEN
		PRINT firstNumber
	ELSE
		PRINT secondNumber
	END IF;
ENDFUNCTION

Q2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100

FUNCTION countingNumbers
	FOR counter in 1 to 100
		PRINT counter
	ENDFOR;
ENDFUNCTION

Q3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION search(firstName)
	FOR each element in the phoneBook array
		IF firstName equals array[i].name THEN
			RETURN array[i]; 
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION

Q4. Using the pseudocode you wrote in the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phoneBook = [
  {name:"Sarah", phoneNum: "760-475-3958"},
  {name:"Adam", phoneNum: "760-458-3958"}];

function search(firstName){
  for (let i=0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
    if (phoneBook[i].name == firstName){
      return phoneBook[i];
    }
  }
}

search("Adam");
